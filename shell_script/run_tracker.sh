#!/bin/bash
# This shell script will run all of the python scripts for AEW tracking in sequence. Note that it is required that you
# specify an initial input file, for convenience, this should be placed in the same directory as these scripts. 
# There are also several assorted subdirectoires that are included for automatic organization. Feel free to look at the
# scripts and change the output directories/names to something that is more convenient for you. Several scripts also have
# the ability to change the output location or input file name: please see below for more details on that. 

# ---- PYTHON ENVIRONMENT ----
# First, this is specific code to run on the NCAR Cheyenne system so it should be modified for your use. 
# There are specific module requirements, so you may have to check the included scripts to see which you need
# to include in your envionment. 

# ------ FIRST, COMPUTE THE NON-DIVERGENT WINDS. -----
# You need u and v winds on a 1x1 degree grid. It is highly recommended that at least 10 days of data are included. 
# The tracking needs a bit of spinup, so if you are running this on model output, I recommend you append at least
# 1 week of analysis/reanalysis data prior to the first model timestep. 

# NOTE: The following non-divergent wind script REQUIRES a global domain (uses spherical harmonics). Otherwise, you 
# should skip this step. This step likely has minor ramifications for the final output.
